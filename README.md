## 📌 Overview
This project compares traditional feature extraction methods (HOG, LBP, Edge Detection) with deep learning features (MobileNetV2) for MNIST digit classification using Random Forest. Key findings show HOG outperforms deep features while being more computationally efficient.

## 🚀 Key Results
| Method          | Accuracy | Training Time |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| HOG             | 97.09%   | 66.34s        |
| Edge Detection  | 87.30%   | 17.04s        |
| MobileNetV2     | 78.71%   | 64.89s        |
| LBP             | 60.77%   | 16.23s        |
